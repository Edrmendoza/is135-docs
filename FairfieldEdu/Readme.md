# The FairfieldEdu Project
>This project applies the principles of visual design to improve the user experience of an existing website.
>
> As part of a rebranding effort, in January 2014 Fairfield University launched a completely new website website. The previous website, built circa 2007, was serviceable but ...
  * It looked a bit stale/stodgy, not in keeping with modern web design
  * It was incompatible with mobile devices  
  * Its design was inconsistent, with page layouts, graphics, and other design varying quite a bit from one section of the site to another 
>
> While the newer, cleaner site was a big improvement, it was released with a few subtle usability and layout bugs. By the end of this tutorial our version of the site will work as intended, free of the design flaws that dogged the original.

The tutorial flows in 2 parts:
* [Part 1: Design for Readability](Part1.md)
* [Part 2: Layout Debugging](Part2.md)

Do not start any of the tutorials until instructed. They are designed to correspond to specific chapters of your textbook.
