# IS135 Term Project, Fall 2015

## The Assignment in a Nutshell
On April 6, 2016 the [*Fairfield StagUp* program](http://fairfieldstagup.org) (formerly the *Fairfield University Business Plan Competition*) will be staging its first Showcase event in the Oak Room, BCC. In many respects it is similar to the Business Plan Competition Finale event that it replaces, with student teams vying for startup funding from an panel of alumni investors. This time, however, there is no limit on how much the investor panel can invest and the audience will be privy to the negotiations in real time.

The Showcase is intended to be a focal point for promoting Fairfield University's entrepreneurship programs. There is already a lot of alumni interest in the event, especially among angel investors and consultants who would like to directly engage with our students. In anticipation new followers being attracted to the "bigger ... better" format, the venue has been moved from the DSB Dining Room (which seats ~180) to the Oak Room (~325 seats). The likely venue for the Showcase in 2017 is the Quick Center, which seats over 700 people.

Given the nature of the event and the audience it is expected to attract, Fairfield University has decided to promote it with its own website. The site would replace the current FairfieldStagUp.org site on March 6 (the day after the Qualifers), and remain live until after the summer Board of Trustees meeting. The site would then revert back to the current FairfieldStagUp.org for the start of the 2016-2017 school year.

**Working in teams of 2-3 students, you will collaborate to explore and prototype concepts for the new website. The new design should be fully responsive and be in keeping with Fairfield University’s recent rebranding efforts (e.g., the new [Quick Center](http://quickcenter.fairfield.edu) website). However, since the Fairfield StagUp operates as an independently-sponsored extracurricular activity, the branding must not infringe on Fairfield University trademarks. We cannot use the Fairfield U shield, antlers, or wordmark in the masthead, though we can use them in the footer. The design will be completed in phases, with defined milestones leading up to project completion at the end of the semester.**

## Milestone #1: Setup and Persona Analysis
### Action Items (Due October 7)

1. Form your team. You will be assigned a team name in class.
2. Create a repository in the class's GitHub organization:
  * Only **one person** creates the repository folder. The others then clone it from GitHub.
  * Please name the repository as follows: `[team name]-term project`, where `[team-name]` is the name assigned to you in class.
  * The repository folder should include the following:
    * A `Readme.md` file with the team name, team members and a list of links to other files for your project.
      >Use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) to format the file for display in your browser.

    * A folder named `src` that will contain the HTML and CSS for your new site.
      > Why `src`? It's a tradition that goes back many, many years. It's what web developers expect.

    * A folder named `docs` that will contain documentation about your website.
      > Documentation in this case is more than just a user manual. We're using it to share your design work with fellow designers.

  * Each teammate should have commit (write) permissions on the repository.
    > The GitHub organization should take care of this with a minimum of fuss. We'll try to take care of it in class.

  * One team will do this live as a demonstration to the rest of the class.
    >This way we can do it all together.  

3. Write a [Persona Analysis Document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_(user_experience) that describes each segment of the audience for the Showcase event. Each Persona profile should be one page and include all essential data needed to answer why and how the person would choose to attend the event. Write your report as a Markdown file named `Personas.md` in your `docs` folder.
  >If you need to have images, then create an `images` subfolder and link to them there.
  >Look in the [tutorial folders](../Tutorials) of this repository for examples of how to do that.  

4. Review your work with the instructor.

## Milestone #2: Wireframes and Boilerplate
### Action Items (Due October 14)

1. Create a shared Google Drive folder for your team. Use Draw.io to draw up wireframes for your main pages. While you may embellish your wireframe with decoration, be sure that your decorations can actually work well in Bootstrap. Draw your wireframes for both mobile and desktop widths. You’ll find that it’s better to keep the layout fairly lean, with lots of whitespace so that we can make it responsive at all widths.
2. Export your wireframes as PDF files to your Git repository. They should be in a subfolder of the `docs` folder named `wireframes`.
2. You may be asked to show off your wireframes to the class.
3. Create a basic `index.html` page using Bootstrap’s Starter template. Try out some HTML and CSS to make 100% sure that you’ve got the framework linked in properly. You can experiment with other Bootstrap templates if you like. It’s up to you.
4. Review your work with the instructor.

## Milestone #3: Draft HTML & CSS  
### Action Items (Due November 4)

1. Prepare a [Structured Walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1NOlW-2fHIueO4xw5aelD_mKvEtryQpEjLahcMh6s86Y) presentation for your site. You will deliver the presentation in class on November 4. When possible, show actual web pages instead of mockups. The purpose is to get feedback on your work *before* the big push to final submission.
> Raising issues is the whole point of a walkthrough, and you are not helping yourself or anybody else by not trying to discuss them.

2. Use [Markdown Remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) for your slides. Commit the slides to a folder named `prelimary-review` inside your `docs` folder.
> *You will be shown how to do this in class.*

## Milestone #4: Final Submission and Review
### Action Items (Due December 10)
1. Prepare a presentation for your site design. Your presentation should cover at least the following:
  * Your design concept (what you were trying to do)
  > Try to cover this in a slide or two. This is best done by stating goals for your design. The quality of your work would then be assessed in part based on your achievement of your goals.
  * A walkthrough of your site design, section by section
  > Use your time well. Since there is no chance to revise your work, you do not have to open up for questions.  
  * Comments on how the site "works"for each of the personas you have identified as important
  > You can do this one persona at a time or all at once. It might not be a bad idea to step through an essential user story or two showing us how the story would play out with your site.

2. Presentations start at 11:30am. Each team will get 10 minutes to present their work. There will be a peer review survey for everyone to fill out while you are presenting.
  > The review rubric will be given to you on the last day of class. Use it to help you prepare for your presentation.

3. By midnight of December 9, tag your work as "final" in your GitHub repo.
  >You will be shown in class how to tag releases in Git.
