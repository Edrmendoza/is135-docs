# IS135 Tutorials
*We will be completing several tutorial exercises every week. Many will come from the textbook. The rest are covered here. You will find them linked in each week's class agenda on Blackboard.*

* Each tutorial has a Git repository on GitHub. Instructions will be given in Markdown files (like this one) with filenames that end in `.md`. The other files in the repo will be source materials needed to complete the assignment.
* If there are multiple parts to a tutorial then each part will be covered in a separate Markdown file. The filename will indicate the part accordingly.
* You can make your own copy of these instructions using *clone* (but not *fork*). We covered that in the [Setup](Setup.md) assignment on the first day of class. To keep your copy up-to-date, just use click on the repository and use `Repository`â†’`Pull`, which will use a bit of magic to sync your copy with GitHub. Do this at least once per week. Tutorials are being created and edited as we go along. It's your job to keep up.
